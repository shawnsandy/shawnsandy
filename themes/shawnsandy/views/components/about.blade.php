                                   Iâ€™m Shawn Sandy a FULL STACK DESIGNER / WEB DEVELOPER, with a passion for building web applications that can actively engage users in
                                    responsive thought. Enhancing the customer experience and improving product conversion
                                    outcomes. I currently work for a small company in Spring Hill, Florida building SaaS
                                    applications for workforce boards.

                                    I started my career as a graphic designer then quickly moved into web, UI/UX design and interactive media technologies like
                                    Adobe flash, actionscript. Gradually I transitioned into integrating my UI/Designs into
                                    applications like WordPress (php), Magento, Shopify (ruby on rails) Javascript, .NET
                                    etc. Currently I work fulltime as a Front End Developer designing and developing applications
                                    for workforce teams in Florida. I spend most of my spare time exploring and learning
                                    new, existing and emerging technologies that can be used help build better applications.
                                </p>

                                    One of the most important lessons I learned at an early age was that design must FUNCTION. Purpose must exceed aesthetics;
                                    It is the foundation of good design. I believe the same stands true in the development
                                    process, so no matter what the technology - HTML, CSS, PHP, RUBY, .NET, Javascript(ES6)/Angular
                                    etc. My role as both designer and developer is to create products that put function first.
